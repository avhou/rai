	abstract = {With the advent of deepfake videos, video forgery has become a serious threat. Videos in social media are the most common and serious targets. There are some existing works for detecting deepfake videos but very few attempts have been made for videos in social media. This paper presents a neural network based method to detect fake videos. A model, consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a classifier network is proposed. Three different structures, XceptionNet, InceptionV3 and Resnet50 have been considered as the CNN modules and a comparative study has been made. Xception Net has been chosen in the proposed model and paired with the proposed classifier for classification. We used the FaceForensics++ dataset to reach the best model. Our model integrated in the algorithm detects compressed videos in social media.},

	abstract = {The usage of the internet as a fast medium for spreading fake news reinforces the requirement of computational utensils in order to fight for it. Fake videos also called deep fakes that create great intimidation in society in an assortment of social and political behaviour. It can also be utilized for malevolent intentions. Owing to the availability of deep fake generation algorithms at cheap computation power in cloud platforms, realistic fake videos or images are created. However, it is more critical to detect fake content because of the increased complexity of leveraging various approaches to smudge the tampering. Therefore, this work proposes a novel framework to detect fake videos through the utilization of transfer learning in autoencoders and a hybrid model of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Recurrent neural networks (RNN). Unseen test input data are investigated to check the generalizability of the model. Also, the effect of residual image input on accuracy of the model is analyzed. Results are presented for both, with and without transfer learning to validate the effectiveness of transfer learning.},
